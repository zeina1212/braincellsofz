     <h3 align= center> How Can You Be So Sure</h3>
   <p>
     everything is a theory.  No like everythaaanggg is a theory. I know that there are “facts”, but how can we be so sure?
     Literally about any topic. For example, about when you touch fire you will feel a burn. Who said that?like yeah scientifically
     it’s correct but the future is so unpredictable and miracles and strange things do happen.
    </p>

  <h3 align= center> I Do Envy The Dead For Reasons</h3>
    <p>
     A topic that will never not be interesting to me is death. No one alive knows what it’s actually like to be dead, and
     this is what I envy the dead for(dark optimism). There’s a lot of religions and cultures what happens after death, but no
      one can be so sure of it. This is why I don’t mind dying. I know it doesn’t have to be so pleasant, but I will know and
       that’s enough I guess.

  <h3 align= center> Not The First Lifetime?</h3>
    <p>
     Is this necessary the first life? We have history from like a million years ago okay cool but is this the first time a
     million years ago was a thing?? Like maybe the end of the world already happened and this is a new thing (or different
     universe) where there’s a million years ago history and 1900s history and medieval ages but they might’ve happened before.
    </p>
  <h3 align= center> What's A Soul</h3>
    <p>
     What does the word “soul” mean? Is it what makes a human function and live? But isn’t the brain and body enough? Cause
     when clones are made, they don’t get a soul CAUSE WHATS A SOUL, but they still move yeah? Like not like a human prolly but
     they

        I wish I were a plant or non-existent. I wouldn’t have to hurt my brain by thinking. I can’t stop it from thinking.
